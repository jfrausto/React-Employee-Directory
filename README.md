## Usage

This application uses the React Framework to dynamically search and display employees instantly as you type. Sample employee information is supplied by the [random user](https://randomuser.me/) API. Use this application on your database to search for employees by name, email, phone number or date of birth. You can also sort each category by clicking on the carrot on each header.
